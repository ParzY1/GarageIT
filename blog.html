            <h2>Pi-hole Core v5.18 released to fix an Authenticated Arbitrary File Read with root privileges vulnerability</h2>
            <p>A vulnerability was recently discovered in Pi-hole’s gravity script that would allow for any system file to be arbitrarily read and presented to an authenticated user on the web interface. This release mitigates the vulnerability by limiting gravity’s ability to read local file’s to only those that are explicitly readable by anyone on the system….</p>

            <h2>Fixing two new DNSSEC vulnerabilities</h2>
            <p>Today, we have been informed about two DNSSEC vulnerabilities in dnsmasq, which Pi-hole FTL is forked from. Both vulnerabilities, via specially crafted DNSSEC answers, can lead DNSSEC validators down a very CPU intensive and time costly validation/NSEC3 hash calculation path. This results in degraded performance and denial of service in trivially orchestrated attacks.</p>
